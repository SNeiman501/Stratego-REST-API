# Stratego-REST-API
This is a REST-API made to play the board game "Stratego" and a UI that allowes it to be played by humans

## How to use(must include http endpoints in further readme updates)
- log in a user (you can use the synchronization phrase to play with a specific opponent instead of a random one)
- set the position in wich you want your units to be placed
- make moves until winner is determined

## About the origin of the code
this was the final group project for the class (SI207) of the computer science degree from UNLP university in Argentina.
The rest API was done 100% by me. The front end will be re-made in this repository, with a different implementation.

## state of development
as of this date (9/12/22) this project is considered abandoned. My efforts will be temporarily diverted to a side project which has more economic viability.
It should be noted that the backend works fine, and a working version of the front end does exist, although I would consider it to be cumbersome and inefficient. In case someone wants to see it contact me at santiago.neiman32@gmail.com
